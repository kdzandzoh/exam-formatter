# Exam Formatter
I created this script using PyPDF2 and Python in order to avoid the repetitive and time consuming task of seperating the pages manually for each of my exams which was useful during online schooling

## How does it work
1. Put the file you'd like to seperate into the same directory as `exam-formatter.py`
2. Open the terminal and enter `python exam-formatter.py`
3. You will be prompted to enter the name of the file to seperate
4. Enter the name of the file and enjoy!
